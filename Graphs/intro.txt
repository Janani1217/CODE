Degree : 
    1. undirected graph : all edges connected to a node is its Degree
    2. direected graph : indegree : edges coming towared the node   
                        outdegree : edges outgoing from the node 

path : sequence of node for traversal , for which every node is visited only once.

implementation of graphs : 
    1. adj matrix : 2 D array
    2. adj list : map <list>
